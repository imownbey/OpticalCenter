# OpticalCenter

Eyyy this finds the optical center of an image (9 out of 10 times ....) as is described [here](https://medium.com/@erqiudao/the-play-button-is-not-optical-alignment-4cea11bda175)

It is also reversed but that seems simple to fix.

When it fails it seems the edge detection is failing or things are out of order:
